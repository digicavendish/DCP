It has been the goal of the [Digital Cavendish Project][DCP-site] to make the texts of Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle (1623-1673) accessible to all readers. Currenlty, there are few opitons for reading Cavendish's texts as they were printed. The reading editions presented here are an attempt to provide her work in easy to read editions that sytlistically and and visually reproduce her printed work.
